    q1: 'How do I know the ticket is valid and matches what was ordered?',
    a1: 'Every ticket is reviewed by the PockTick team within 24 hours of upload. We verify the date, time, location, seat type, and price to ensure it matches the event details.',
    q2: 'How do you ensure the seller is trustworthy?',
    a2: 'Private sellers must go through a strict one-time verification process including ID, photo, and video. Each person can have only one lifetime account. If a seller is caught cheating, they are permanently banned. In severe cases, legal action can be taken through PockTick.',
    q3: 'Why are tickets locked until opening?',
    a3: 'To protect buyers. Tickets from private individuals stay locked until the buyer chooses to open them. If there’s a problem, we compare the time the ticket was opened with the official check-in time. If opened after check-in — the buyer is protected and refunded. If opened before — the responsibility lies with the buyer.',
    q4: 'When should I open the ticket?',
    a4: 'Open your ticket just a few seconds before entering the event. This ensures full protection in case of a dispute.',
    q5: 'What happens if there was a problem after I opened the ticket?',
    a5: 'You can file an appeal in the app. We investigate each case with the ticket company and respond accordingly.',
    q6: 'When does the money transfer to the seller?',
    a6: '24 hours after the event ends. This gives time for the buyer to report any issues before funds are released.',
      q8: 'How can I sell a ticket through PockTick?',
    a8: 'After completing a one-time verification, private sellers can upload tickets and transfer them safely to buyers with full protection on both sides.',
